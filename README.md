# BST_visualizer
The BST (Binary Search Tree) Visualizer using Java AWT Swing is a graphical application that allows users to visualize the process of inserting nodes into a binary search tree and perform preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.

Key features of the application include:

1. BST Creation: Users can interactively insert nodes into the binary search tree by clicking on the visualization area. The tree structure will be updated dynamically as new nodes are inserted.

2. Preorder Traversal: The application allows users to initiate the preorder traversal, which displays the order of nodes visited in a "root-left-right" sequence. The nodes will be highlighted in the visualization accordingly.

3. Inorder Traversal: Users can trigger the inorder traversal, showing the nodes visited in a "left-root-right" sequence. The visualization highlights the nodes as they are being visited.

4. Postorder Traversal: The app enables users to perform the postorder traversal, presenting the nodes visited in a "left-right-root" sequence. The corresponding nodes are highlighted during the process.

5. Node Visualization: Each node in the binary search tree is displayed with its associated value, making it easy for users to understand the tree's structure and traversal sequences.

Overall, the BST Visualizer using Java AWT Swing provides an interactive and educational tool for users to understand the binary search tree data structure better. By visualizing the insertion process and different traversal techniques, users can grasp the underlying concepts of binary search trees more effectively.
